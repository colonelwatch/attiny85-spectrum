## Introduction

SSD1306 driver is Arduino style C/C++ library with unicode support. The library can be compiled for plain Linux
(for example, raspberry spi), or you can use it with plain avr-gcc compiler without Arduino IDE, or with
ESP32 IDF. It supports monochrome and RGB oleds and has debug mode, allowing to execute code on PC, using SDL2.0.
Initially the library is intended for very small microcontrollers (with a little of RAM). It was developed to use as
few resources as possible, but still has powerful capabilities, allowing to develop nice animation.
It works on any powerful devices like raspberry pi, esp32; and can be easily ported to new platform.

Since ssd1306 library supports different display types: monochrome, 8-bit color, 16-bit color displays, -
there are several group of API functions:

  * Generic API functions (font specific, cursor positioning, menu implementation)
  * 1-bit API functions for monochrome displays (these ones can be used both for color and mono lcd)
  * 8-bit API functions for color displays (these ones work only for color displays)
  * 16-bit API functions for color displays (only color displays)

Also, for graphics animation there special C++ API, called [Nano Engine](nano_engine/README.md).

## Key Features

 * Supports color, monochrome OLED displays, and VGA monitor
 * The library has modular structure, and some modules can be excluded from compilation at all to reduce flash usage.
 * Needs very little RAM (Attiny85 with Damellis package needs minimum 25 bytes of RAM to communicate with OLED)
 * Fast implementation to provide reasonable speed on slow microcontrollers
 * Supports i2c and spi interfaces:
   * i2c (software implementation, Wire library, AVR Twi, Linux i2c-dev)
   * spi (4-wire spi via Arduino SPI library, AVR Spi, AVR USI module)
 * Primitive graphics functions (lines, rectangles, pixels, bitmaps)
 * Printing text to display (using fonts of different size, you can use GLCD Font Creator to create new fonts)
 * Includes [graphics engine](https://github.com/lexus2k/ssd1306/wiki/Using-NanoEngine-for-systems-with-low-resources) to support
   double buffering on tiny microcontrollers.
 * Can be used for game development (bonus examples):
   * Arkanoid game ([arkanoid](examples/games/arkanoid) in old style API and [arkanoid8](examples/games/arkanoid8) in new style API)
   * Simple [Lode runner](examples/games/lode_runner) game.
   * [Snowflakes](examples/nano_engine/snowflakes)

The i2c pins can be changed via API functions. Please, refer to documentation. Keep in mind,
that the pins, which are allowed for i2c or spi interface, depend on the hardware.
The default spi SCLK and MOSI pins are defined by SPI library, and DC, RST, CES pins are configurable
through API.

Digispark users, please check compilation options in your Arduino prior to using this library.
Ssd1306 library requires at least c++11 and c99 (by default Digispark package misses the options
-std=gnu11, -std=gnu++11).
